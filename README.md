# Gazebo Propeller Plugin
## Description
This plugin simulates the thrust force and the torque generated by the propeller without aero-dynamic environments. In general, it gives a approximate thrust force and torque function in following format:
$$ThrustForce = ForceConstant \times \omega^2$$
$$Torque = TorqueConstant \times \omega^2$$
Where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the propeller, the thrust force and torque were applied to the _parent link_ of the specified joint.

__Mention: This plugin does not actuates the propeller but only simulate the behavior of propeller. To drive the propeller, please use gazebo_ros2_control plugin.__

## Dependence
This plugin uses `colcon tools` to build, and before you compiling the code, make sure you have following dependencies:
* ROS2 colcon tools
* Gazebo v11+
* libgazebo-dev
```bash
sudo apt install libgazebo-dev
```

## Usage
To build this plugin, please first create a ros2 workspace,
```bash
mkdir ros2_ws
cd ros2_ws/
mkdir src
cd src
```

Then clone this project into the `src` folder,
```bash
git clone git@github.com:UoN-Hari/gz_propeller_plugins.git gz_propeller_plugins
```

Build this project,
```bash
cd ..
colcon build
```

Add the plugin to your `GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH`,
```bash
echo "export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:${pwd}/build/gz_propeller_plugins" >> ~/.bashrc
```

To use this plugin in your gazebo, add the following context in your urdf file:
```xml
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="PropellerPlugin" filename="libgz_propeller_plugins.so">
    <!-- 
        param: 
            name = "your joint name"
            direction = "cw" or "ccw"
            torque_constant = "a double value"
            force_constant = "a double value"
    -->
    <joint name="" direction="" torque_constant="" force_constant="" />
    ...
  </plugin>
</gazebo>
```

## TODOs
* Add more parameters of the propeller to get a more accurate performance with the real world.
* Remove the building depend `colcon tool`.
